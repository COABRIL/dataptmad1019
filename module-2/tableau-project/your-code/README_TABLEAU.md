# Files

You will not find the file in the repository as this data is confidential, but you will find some images that explain the analysis we have carried out.

## Caracterizaci√≥n del usuario

The story we have elaborated consists of 3 analyses. The first one, analyzes 4 basic aspects of the profile. In this case we see how the users are mostly young people from normal establishments, who select the "type 1" type of logging through devices with an iOS operating system.

## Key KPI's
In the following analysis, we will visualize the evolution of the main quality indicators valued by the users. We observe that all have a positive evolution over time, although the "connection stability" can be improved by obtaining ratings below the rest and the main indicators such as the ISC or the NPS.

To find out more about where any of these aspects may be failing, filters have been enabled on the type of logging or the type of establishment.

## Homogeneidad servicio

In the last analysis, we went deeper into how homogeneous the service is perceived. We see how young and old live very different experiences within their age groups. The same is true for those who connect through "type 2" logging.
